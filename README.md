## Problem Statement
Loan approval is a critical process in the banking sector.
Manual evaluation is time-consuming and often lacks transparency.
There is a need for an automated and explainable AI-based system
to assist banks in loan approval decisions.

---

## Solution Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning and AI-based loan approval system that:
- Predicts loan approval status
- Uses Explainable AI (SHAP) to justify decisions
- Generates human-readable explanations
- Performs basic fairness checks

---

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Loan Approval Classification Dataset
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data

---

## Approach
1. Data preprocessing and missing value handling
2. Feature encoding and transformation
3. Machine Learning model training
4. Model evaluation using classification metrics
5. Explainable AI using SHAP
6. AI-generated decision explanations

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- Google Colab

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Ethical AI Considerations
- Explainability using SHAP values
- Fairness analysis across applicant attributes
- Transparent decision-making

---

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size
- No real-time banking data
- External economic factors not included

---

## Future Scope
- Integration with live banking systems
- Advanced bias mitigation techniques
- Deployment as an API service

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning combined with AI techniques
can improve transparency and fairness in loan approval decisions.
